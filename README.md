## Definition

### Net Zero
Net zero emissions refers to establishing a balance between the man-made greenhouse gas emissions being produced, and those being taken out of the atmosphere.

In a practical sense, net zero emissions means continuing to produce emissions, as long as they’re offset by processes that reduce greenhouse gases by the same amount.

### Carbon Neutral
Carbon neutral is a term used to describe an entity – business, service, product etc. – where the carbon emissions created during operations are balanced through funding carbon-reduction projects somewhere else in the world. The term carbon neutral is often used interchangeably with net-zero.

The climate-focused projects that receive funding are often called “offsets” because they’re used to offset the emissions from the companies that are funding them.
